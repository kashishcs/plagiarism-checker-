#  Overview
Plagiarism Checker is a fully client-side web application that compares two texts using five independent similarity algorithms and presents results in a clean, interpretable dashboard.

This project is designed as a portfolio-ready Computer Science project demonstrating:
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Front-end engineering  
- Result interpretation & UX design
- Using multiple algorithms reduces bias from any single method and provides a more reliable similarity estimate.

---

# Disclaimer
This project demonstrates similarity detection techniques and is not a replacement for institutional plagiarism detection systems.

---

#  Features
- Five similarity algorithms
  - Cosine Similarity
  - Jaccard Index
  - Levenshtein Distance
  - Dice Coefficient
  - Word Overlap

- Weighted plagiarism score 
- Risk labels: Low / Medium / High
- Highlighted matching words
- 100% client-side (privacy-friendly)

---

# Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **GitHub Pages**

---

# Why Client-Side Only?
This project is intentionally built as a client-side application to:
- Preserve user privacy
- Avoid unnecessary data storage
- Focus on algorithmic implementation and UI clarity

Backend integration is planned as a future enhancement.

---

# How It Works
1. User inputs two texts  
2. Text preprocessing  
3. Algorithm execution  
4. Weighted aggregation  
5. Visual interpretation
